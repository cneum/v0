My abstract was accepted as a Podium Presentation for Clinical Paper Session 3 at the 75th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. I recorded this presentation for attendees as this was ASSH's first virtual meeting, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This basic science study was the first report on the use of improperly sized resorbable nerve wraps in a noninjury animal nerve model.
